# BiblioFile
### Back End Capstone Project 
___

An ASP.NET MVC Web App that allows a user to upload books from to a SQL sever database. The user can keep two lists: books that are read and books that are to be read. When viewing the books that are to be read, the user is able to click a button labeled "Mark as Read" and the book will now appear in the list of books that have been read. Both lists are searchable and all books have more detailed view that is accessible by click.
